## Dear Esteemed Researchers, Beverage Enthusiasts, and Party Scholars,

We are pleased (and slightly buzzed) to invite submissions for the First PARTYCom Conference ( **April 12, 2025**) – a groundbreaking full day symposium dedicated to the scientific exploration of drinking, questionable PowerPoint slides, and unforgettable birthday celebrations.

This year’s theme: **"From Pints to PowerPoint: The Art of Drinking and Presenting"**

We welcome submissions in, but not limited to, the following highly relevant research areas:

- 🍺 Beerology & fun facts: Who are you and what are you doing?
- 🍷 Wine & Wisdom – What thoughts do you have that you want to share with us?
- 🍹 Cocktail Club - Tell us a fun story about yourself
- 🥃 Whisky & Philosophy – Oh no we are old.. What fun thing, old and new, do you want to talk about?
- 🍾 Champagne & Celebration - What is a thing you are particularly good or bad at?
- 🏆 Competitive Drinking & Speed-Presentation Techniques – Do some funny stuff while chugging booze

### Presentation Format:

- Short, entertaining PowerPoint talks (5-7 min) – preferably created after two drinks.
- Live beverage experiments encouraged.
- Q&A sessions may devolve into toasts.

### Perks of Participation:
- ✅ No Reviewer #2 – All submissions are accepted because we’re here to have fun.
- ✅ Free Drinks (while supplies last – bring your own backup).
- ✅ Prestigious PARTYCom Certificate for your academic CV.
- ✅ Guaranteed Publication in our post-event Proceedings of Alcoholic Research & Theoretical Yelling (PARTY Journal).

### How to Submit:
- Email your presentation, partner & preferred drinks to peter.zdankin[at]uni-due.de
- Please also write me a short real or made up description of you to include in the speaker list
- No full papers needed – just show up and bring a PowerPoint.
- Dress code: Business casual or beer festival chic. Bonus points for funny outfits
- Join us in Duisburg on **April 12, 2025**, for a full day of intellectual discourse, slightly chaotic presentations, and an epic birthday bash.
